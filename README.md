Aero-Client-1.8!

The unreleased custom Aero Client 1.8.9, intended to wipe out the reskin portion of the client and become the new face of Aero Client.

## What is Aero Client?
Aero Client is a old 1.7.10 CheatBreaker reskin which added a lot of new features, had to be gone sadly.
Now back with the drip! ðŸ”¥

This repository however, contains the non-reskin version of the client, which was supposed to remove the reskin completely.

### What is Client Archive? 
We are an org meant for people to enjoy old unreleased clients which are not for the public or just been long gone.

Note that this is just the src.
